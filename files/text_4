the botanist said that she herself had never seen one before 
but after consulting her colleagues she was to report that 
attempts had been made to introduce the plant at a nursery 
in g√∂teborg
and that it might
of course
be cultivated by 
amateur botanists
it was difficult to grow in sweden 
because it thrived in a dry climate and had to remain 
indoors half of the year
it would not thrive in calcareous soil 
and it had to be watered from below
it needed pampering
