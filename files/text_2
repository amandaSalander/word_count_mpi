the plant was native to the australian bush and uplands
where it was to be found among tussocks of grass
there it was called desert snow 
someone at the botanical gardens in 
uppsala would later confirm that it was a plant seldom cultivated in sweden
the botanist wrote in her report that it 
was related to the tea tree and that it was sometimes 
confused with its more common cousin Leptospermum 
scoparium
which grew in abundance in New-Zealand 
What 
distinguished them
she pointed out
was that rubinette had 
a small number of microscopic pink dots at the tips
of the 
petals
giving the flower a faint pinkish tinge
