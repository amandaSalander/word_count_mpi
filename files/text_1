A NOTE ABOUT THE AUTHOR

PROLOGUE  
A Friday in November  
It happened every year, was almost a ritual. And th
is was 
his eighty-second birthday. When, as usual, the flo
wer was 
delivered, he took off the wrapping paper and then 
picked 
up the telephone to call Detective Superintendent M
orell 
who, when he retired, had moved to Lake Siljan in D
alarna. 
They were not only the same age, they had been born
 on the 
same day—which was something of an irony under the 
circumstances. The old policeman was sitting with h
is coffee, 
waiting, expecting the call. 
It arrived.
What is it this year?
I don’t know what kind it is. I’ll have to get som
eone to tell 
me what it is. It’s white.
No letter, I suppose.
Just the flower. The frame is the same kind as last year. One 
of those do-it-yourself ones.
Postmark
Stockholm.
Handwriting
Same as always, all in capitals. Upright, neat lettering.
With that, the subject was exhausted, and not another word 
was exchanged for almost a minute. The retired policeman 
leaned back in his kitchen chair and drew on his pipe. He 
knew he was no longer expected to come up with a pithy 
comment or any sharp question which would shed a new 
light on the case. Those days had long since passed
, and the 
exchange between the two men seemed like a ritual 
attaching to a mystery which no-one else in the whole world 
had the least interest in unravelling.
The Latin name was Leptospermum Myrtaceae rubinette. 
It was a plant about four inches high with small, heather-like 
foliage and a white flower with five petals about one inch across.
